# hello-world
## This is a test repo to start using GitHub 
This repo will be for tests, with the goal of being able to do all my school work here.

* Markdown works

1. Find out if version histories work the same on word docs
2. Can you integrate with Todoist?
3. Using master as an outline tool?
  * Master is main outline;
  * Each branch is a major section; and 
  * Sub-branches are each sub-issue 
    * This will include the tests and cases for each subissue
